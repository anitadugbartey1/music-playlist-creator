### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

 I felt unprepared to work on the modal feature of the playlist. The modal was very sensitive and every little structural change completely destroyed the live version of the site so I had to work on it very carefully. I think the book reviews lab proved to be the most helpful when designing the javascript aspect of my project. The same way we had to pull reviews is the same way we had to pull song data so I think it was the lab that prepared me the most to complete the final project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I haad more time I would have added more stretch features and made the site more functional. I wanted to allow users to delete playlists but did not have enough time to do so. I also would have changed the way users saw the shuffle screen. The shuffled container could have been more colorful.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The design and the css aspect of the demo wnet really well. I love designing the project. Front end work isnt my favorite but I love getting to play with different color schemes to express my pallette and tastes. I think placing the stretch features presented the most difficulty because I would design the body of my feature and struggle with the functionality of it. The search bar is the most promininent example of this struggle. I think I would try to create a feature that would allow a user to close out a tab without pressing the close button or just by clicking any part of the screen which someone did.

### Shout out

Shoutout to Evelyn because she helped me build the featured section of the playlist explorer. She helped me use a randomizer function to make the featured section automatically suggest different playlists.
